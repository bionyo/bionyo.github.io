            PRINT LAYOUT IS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND UP MY ALLEY BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO TOO MUCH TECHNICAL WORK UNTIL THE VERY END. THE PROCESS OF MAKING SURE ALL COMPONENTS ARE OF PRINT SETTINGS WAS DIFFICULT. I USED A PORTRAIT OF MYSELF PAINTED IN GOUCHE TO HAVE A TRADITIONAL PIECE IN CONTRAST TO ALL THE DIGITAL WORKS I'VE CREATED. I MADE A DESIGN OF THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF A MINIMAL THEME WITH THE STARK CONTRAST OF BLACK, WHITE AND YELLOW TO PORTRAY A BUMBLEBEE AS HOMAGE TO MY FORMER NICKNAME IN HIGH SCHOOL.
