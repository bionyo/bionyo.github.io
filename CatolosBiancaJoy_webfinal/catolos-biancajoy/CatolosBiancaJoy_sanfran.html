        San Francisco: the best and the worst
        </h1> 
        
        <h2>
            The best neighborhood is the Richmond District
        </h2> 
        <p>
            I enjoy the variety of different shops and the views of <strong> Golden State park </strong>
        </p>
        <h2>
            The worst neighborhood is the Mission
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are <em> TOO MANY </em> hills to walk
