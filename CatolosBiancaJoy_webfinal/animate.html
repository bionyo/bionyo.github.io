        <h1> [ MIDNIGHT SNACK GONE WRONG ] </h1>
        <p>
            ANIMATE GAVE ME THE BIGGEST HEADACHE OF MY LIFE BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY COMPONENTS IN ADDITION TO THE VISUALS SUCH AS SOUNDS, MOTIONS, AND KEYFRAMES. THE STORY PLOT OF THIS THAT SHERYL THE PEANUT HAVING A DELICIOUS MIDNIGHT SNACK OF PEANUT BUTTER. HOWEVER, SHE WAS CAUGHT BY LIILIAN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND WAS THROWN OUT OF THE HOUSE. LILLIAN AT THE END WAS VICTORIOUS GIVING US A CUTE WINK TO NOT MESS WITH HER THINGS. I WANTED INDICATE THE ACTION OF LILLIAN'S RAGE WITHOUT ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF ANIMATING IT, BUT I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS.
